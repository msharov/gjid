GJID v1.0 for Linux
------------------------

Linux GJID is a port of a DOS shareware game with that name. Unlike the DOS
game this is freeware. I have not used any of the DOS version's code, so I
don't think I am violating anything. After all, there are so many breakout
clones :) Feel free to distribute it or use the code at your
discretion (although I would like it if you told me) The levels are
taken copied entirely from there, although the data file format is not
supported - you will have to code in the levels by hand.

I have not been able to contact the author of the DOS game, due to expiration 
of his E-Mail address (?), which can be found in the document below.
I can be reached at msharov@rucs2.sunlab.cs.runet.edu, which is a valid
address until January 1996. After that you can try to locate me through
the Four11 directory (http://www.Four11.com).

I would like you to think of this as a direct port, so the following
document, taken from the original DOS GJID distribution, is included. The
controls are not the same as described below - they are explained in the
game's titles.

My GJID also has a builtin level editor, which can be started by running
gjid with an argument. You will need a mouse to use it. The controls are:
	'n' - Next (or new) level
	'p' - Previous level
	'q' - Quit

---------------------------

To compile GJID you will need SVGALIB installed. I have used v1.2, but it is
possible that it may compile with earlier versions too. You should be able
to link with -lvga -lvgagl .

Edit the Makefiles in gamelib and src and compile script in tools to set
your compiler and options. The 'build' script assumes that you have bash in
/bin/bash and that you have awk; if it is not so, edit build and src/mkdata . 
After build is finished, which on my 486DX33 takes 3.68 minutes, you will be 
asked to install as root because GJID has to be suid root.

Enjoy the game!

GJID 2.0 - A game by John Remyn.
Copyright 1990, 1992 Galifir Developments.


GJID is a fascinating puzzle game, which will keep you glued to the screen for
quite some time. It combines intricate puzzles with straightforward gameplay
in 14 challenging levels.

This game is shareware. You are encouraged to freely copy and distribute it,
provided that no fee is charged beyond normal media duplication and shipping
costs, and that no changes are made to the distribution archive contents. If
you like this game, you are strongly encouraged to register it. You will
receive the latest registered version of the game, along with a number of
other (unregistered) games by the authors, on diskette. The registered
version includes a level editor which allows you to create and modify GJID
levels in a user friendly environment. For further information see the end
of this file and the file ORDER.FRM.


---- Hardware Requirements ---------------------------------------------------

    EGA or VGA compatible card recommended, CGA works also.
    128K of free conventional memory.
    DOS v2.0 or greater.

Disclaimer:

    This program is provided on an "as is" basis without warranty of any kind.
    In no event will the authors be liable to you for any damages.


---- Installing & Configuring ------------------------------------------------

Just put all files in the archive (or on the distribution diskette) in a
directory on hard or floppy disk, which you will probably already have done.
The files require about 90 Kb of free disk space.

Now make that directory the current directory and type: gjid <enter>, and the
program will run.


---- The Story ---------------------------------------------------------------

The story of GJID can be found in the scrolling text on the main menu screen
in the game itself.


---- The Main Menu -----------------------------------------------------------

The menu is fairly self-explanatory. The only option which might need some
clarification is F3, change colorset. GJID (when run with EGA or VGA monitors)
uses a diffent color scheme for each level. With this option you can select
the color the first level will have. You can also change the colorset during
play.


---- The Game ----------------------------------------------------------------

Getting to grips with the game should be easy. The objective is to clear
levels from crates containing peace-threatening armaments. There are three
types of crates, which only differ in visual appearance. A level consists of a
maze through which you have to push the crates onto disposers, where they are
vaporized. However, this will not always be easy. You cannot push crates
around corners nor can you push more than one crate at a time, and you cannot
pull them back. Although these three limitations alone provide lots of fun
(and frustration), there is another element to the game, the 'one-way
passages'. You can get onto these passages from only one direction, but move
off them in any direction. It is possible to push crates over these passages,
or leave crates standing on them. There is also an exit on each level (marked
with an E), onto which you should move as soon as you
have disposed of all crates in a level. Note that you can move
and push crates over exits, and move over disposers.

There is a limited take-back move facility, which allows you to take back a
wrong crate push, provided you haven't moved since the push. Ordinary moves
cannot be taken back.

You score points by finishing a level. The basic score is equal to the number of
disposed crates. You gain more bonus points by making fewer moves.
When completing a level for the first time, you may find that you receive no
bonus at all because you made too many moves. When you play it again, you'll
know the basic strategy, and may find a shorter route, threreby gaining more
bonus points. There is not necessarily only one way to finish a level.

Truly finishing the game is done by finishing all levels in one run. It is
possible to skip levels you don't want to play, because you have already
finished the level before, or haven't solved it yet. Levels are not sorted on
difficulty, so you may find that while one level is very tough, the next is a
doddle.

We guarantee that all levels in the original game can be finished. We cannot
guarantee this for levels created by other people using the level editor.

When passing the last level, 50 extra bonus points are awarded for every level
that you have finished.

The key definitions:

    Cursor keys : move GJID
    F1          : show help (key definitions)
    F2          : take back move
    F3          : change colorset
    F4          : toggle sound on/off
    F5          : restart level (unconditional)
    F8          : skip current level
    Escape      : return to main menu

Enjoy!


---- Please register ---------------------------------------------------------

Many hours of work have been put into this game. If you like it, please
consider registering it. To encourage you to register, we offer you this for
$10:

    - The registered version of GJID, including a comprehensive level editor,
      which enables you to create your own levels. Designing new levels is
      even more challenging than playing them.

    - The Solar Hockey League, a future sports simulation with fast and
      furious action. Play against one of the challenging computer
      teams, or compete with a friend (which is great fun).

    - Hi-Q, a beautiful implementation of the classical board game. Not as
      taxing on the mind as GJID, and not so exhilarating as The Solar Hockey
      League, but showing some very nice 256 color VGA graphics. This game
      also supports SuperVGA graphics on many SVGA cards, using 256 color
      modes with resolutions of 640x400 or 640x480 pixels.

    - Any other games which we may have developed since this release of
      GJID.


---- Technical Info and History ----------------------------------------------

Programming was started on this game in 1989. It was released through the
Public (Software) Library in Houston in 1990. Now (in 1992) colors and small
details have been improved, a comprehensive level editor has been created for
the registered version and some real documentation has been written.


--- Ordering Information -----------------------------------------------------

Send cash (bills) in a double envelope or in an envelope with some paper
(possibly the order form) wrapped around the bills. An international
money order will probably cost you a fee comparable to the registration
amount. You can also use American Express Travelers Checks. Please do
not send coins or other checks. Send the money along with the order
form, or the information asked in the order form if you don't have easy
access to a printer, to the address below. Remember to add proper
postage for delivery to Europe. Mail usually takes a few days to reach
Europe from North America. We will respond within 3 weeks at least, but
usually within a few days.

Comments, suggestions and bug reports are always welcome. For these,
if you have access to Electronic Mail, you can use the following Internet
address: hhanemaa@cs.ruu.nl
