In the year 32333 AD two robot cities on the planet Nikarade were
arming themselves against each other. Both set up large complexes
in which powerful photon disruptors were stored. After many years
of increasing tension on of the cities elected another leader who
attempted to make peace with the enemy. The cities finally agreed
to an entente in 32407 and to recycle some of the created weapons

The problem was that no robot wanted to go down into the dungeons
and accomplish this dangerous task. Finally, one robot named GJID
came forward to take up the job. He was a simple robot and little
to lose. Besides, there was a reward offered for the job.

In this game you play GJID, whose task is to move each crate into
recycling bins. At times complex mazes and one-way doors can make
this quite difficult. GJID is not very powerful and can only move
one crate at a time. Also, he can only push the crates, not pull.

When you have recycled all the crates on the level you should use
the exit door to move on to the next. This weapons complex has 14
levels for you to clear.

=================================================================

     Controls:   Cursor keys to move
                 F1  show this help
                 F6  restart the level
                 F8  skip the level
                 F10 quit the game

This is a clone of the eponymous DOS shareware game written in 92
by John Remyn. I spoke with John in 95, when the first version of
this clone was made. He admired the 8-bit graphics (original game
was done in 4-color CGA) and did not object to its existence. His
email address has since expired and the few contact attempts I've
made recently hit dead ends. The DOS game was $10 shareware and I
include the original registration form below, in case you want to
track John down and give him money for the excellent level design
that make this game what it is.

Aside from being an entertaining puzzle, I also release this game
as an example of using the XCB library for making X applications.
XCB is the new lightweight replacement for Xlib that suffers from
lack of documentation. This game demonstrates how to create small
applications with it and also how to use RENDER for drawing text,
tile sprites, and for hardware scaling of the 320x240 backbuffer.

=================================================================

This version of GJID has no external dependencies, so:

./configure
make
make install

and run:

gjid

Enjoy the game!

GJID 2.0 - A game by John Remyn.
Copyright 1990, 1992 Galifir Developments.

GJID is a fascinating puzzle game, which will keep you glued to
the screen for quite some time. It combines intricate puzzles
with straightforward gameplay in 14 challenging levels.

This game is shareware. You are encouraged to freely copy and
distribute it, provided that no fee is charged beyond normal
media duplication and shipping costs, and that no changes
are made to the distribution archive contents. If you like
this game, you are strongly encouraged to register it. You
will receive the latest registered version of the game, along
with a number of other (unregistered) games by the authors,
on diskette. The registered version includes a level editor
which allows you to create and modify GJID levels in a user
friendly environment. For further information see the end of
this file and the file ORDER.FRM.

---- Please register --------------------------------------------

Many hours of work have been put into this game. If you like it,
please consider registering it. To encourage you to register,
we offer you this for $10:

- The registered version of GJID, including a comprehensive level
  editor, which enables you to create your own levels. Designing
  new levels is even more challenging than playing them.

- The Solar Hockey League, a future sports simulation with fast
  and furious action. Play against one of the challenging
  computer teams, or compete with a friend (which is great fun).

- Hi-Q, a beautiful implementation of the classical board game.
  Not as taxing on the mind as GJID, and not so exhilarating
  as The Solar Hockey League, but showing some very nice 256
  color VGA graphics. This game also supports SuperVGA graphics
  on many SVGA cards, using 256 color modes with resolutions
  of 640x400 or 640x480 pixels.

- Any other games which we may have developed since this release
  of GJID.

---- Technical Info and History ----------------------------------

Programming was started on this game in 1989. It was released
through the Public (Software) Library in Houston in 1990. Now
(in 1992) colors and small details have been improved, a
comprehensive level editor has been created for the registered
version and some real documentation has been written.


--- Ordering Information -----------------------------------------

Send cash (bills) in a double envelope or in an envelope
with some paper (possibly the order form) wrapped around the
bills. An international money order will probably cost you a
fee comparable to the registration amount. You can also use
American Express Travelers Checks. Please do not send coins
or other checks. Send the money along with the order form,
or the information asked in the order form if you don't have
easy access to a printer, to the address below. Remember to
add proper postage for delivery to Europe. Mail usually takes
a few days to reach Europe from North America. We will respond
within 3 weeks at least, but usually within a few days.

Comments, suggestions and bug reports are always welcome. For
