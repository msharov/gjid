In the year 32333 AD two robot cities on the planet Nikarad were arming
themselves against each other. The both set up large complexes in which
powerful photon disrupters were stored. After many years of increasing
tension on of the cities elected another leader who attempted to make
peace with the enemy. The cities finally agreed for an entente to start
in 32407 and to recycle some of the created weapons.

The problem was that no robot wanted to go down into the dungeons and
accomplish this dangerous task. Finally, one robot named GJID came
forward and offered to help. He was a simple robot and had not much to
lose. Besides, there was a reward offered for the job :)

You play GJID in this game as he carefully moves the weapon crates into
recycling bins. Complex mazes and one-way doors make this quite difficult
at times. Unfortunately, GJID is not very powerful and can only move one
crate at a time. Furthermore, he can only push the crates, not pull.

When you have recycled all the crates on the level you should use the
exit door to move on to the next. In this first mission you will go
through 14 levels.
